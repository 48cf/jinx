## Jinx

Jinx (Jinx Is Not Xbstrap) is a meta-build-system for bootstrapping operating system
distributions inspired by xbstrap (https://github.com/managarm/xbstrap).

Documentation is currently lacking as this project is pretty new and I did not
have time to write it yet, but a relatively complete example of Jinx usage can be found at
https://github.com/vlang/vinix.
